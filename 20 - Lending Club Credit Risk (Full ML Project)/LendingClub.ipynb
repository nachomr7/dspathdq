    "# Lending Club Credit Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we'll focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's [credit risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk). Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/). Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace [here](https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Lending Club works\n",
    "\n",
    "Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing their past financial history, the reason for the loan, and more. Lending Club evaluates each borrower's credit score using past historical data and assign an interest rate to the borrower. A higher interest rate means that the borrower is riskier and more unlikely to pay back the loan while a lower interest rate means that the borrower has a good credit history is more likely to pay back the loan. If the borrower accepts the interest rate, then the loan is listed on the Lending Club marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors are primarily interested in receiveing a return on their investments. Approved loans are listed on the Lending Club website, where qualified investors can browse recently approved loans, the borrower's credit score, the purpose for the loan, and other information from the application. Once they're ready to back a loan, they select the amount of money they want to fund. Once a loan's requested amount is fully funded, the borrower receives the money they requested minus the origination fee that Lending Club charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The borrower then makes monthly payments back to Lending Club either over 36 months or over 60 months. Lending Club redistributes these payments to the investors. This means that investors don't have to wait until the full amount is paid off to start to see money back. If a loan is fully paid off on time, the investors make a return which corresponds to the interest rate the borrower had to pay in addition the requested amount. Many loans aren't completely paid off on time, however, and some borrowers default on the loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. In this course, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically [on their website](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). You can select a few different year ranges to download the datasets (in CSV format) for both approved and declined loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also find a data dictionary (in XLS format) which contains information on the different column names towards the bottom of the page. We recommend downloading the data dictionary to so you can refer to it whenever you want to learn more about what a column represents in the datasets. Here's a link to the data dictionary file hosted on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit#gid=2081333097).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011, since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off."

Only the `Fully Paid` and `Charged Off` values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still on going and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the `Default` status resembles the `Charged Off` status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either `Fully Paid` and `Charged Off` as the loan's status and then transform the `Fully Paid` values to `1` for the positive case and the `Charged Off` values to `0` for the negative case."

    "Some of the columns seem like they represent categorical values, but we should confirm by checking the number of unique values in those columns:\n",

    "- `home_ownership`: home ownership status, can only be 1 of 4 categorical values according to the data dictionary,\n",
    "- `verification_status`: indicates if income was verified by Lending Club,\n",
    "- `emp_length`: number of years the borrower was employed upon time of application,\n",
    "- `term`: number of payments on the loan, either 36 or 60,\n",
    "- `addr_state`: borrower's state of residence,\n",
    "- `purpose`: a category provided by the borrower for the loan request,\n",
    "- `title`: loan title provided the borrower,\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some columns that represent numeric values, that need to be converted:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int_rate`: interest rate of the loan in %,\n",
    "- `revol_util`: revolving line utilization rate or the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to all available credit, read more here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the first row's values for `purpose` and `title`, it seems like these columns could reflect the same information. Let's explore the unique value counts separately to confirm if this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, some of the columns contain date values that would require a good amount of feature engineering for them to be potentially useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `earliest_cr_line`: The month the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened,\n",
    "- `last_credit_pull_d`: The most recent month Lending Club pulled credit for this loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these date features require some feature engineering for modeling purposes, let's remove these date columns from the Dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the `purpose` and `title` columns do contain overlapping information but we'll keep the `purpose` column since it contains a few discrete values. In addition, the `title` column has data quality issues since many of the values are repeated with slight modifications (e.g. `Debt Consolidation` and `Debt Consolidation Loan` and `debt consolidation`).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the following mapping to clean the `emp_length` column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"10+ years\": 10\n",
    "- \"9 years\": 9\n",
    "- \"8 years\": 8\n",
    "- \"7 years\": 7\n",
    "- \"6 years\": 6\n",
    "- \"5 years\": 5\n",

    "- \"3 years\": 3\n",
    "- \"2 years\": 2\n",
    "- \"1 year\": 1\n",
    "- \"< 1 year\": 0\n",
    "- \"n/a\": 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the `addr_state` column contains many discrete values and we'd need to add 49 dummy variable columns to use it for classification. This would make our Dataframe much larger and could slow down how quickly the code runs. Let's remove this column from consideration."
